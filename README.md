Uncertainty analysis of Hydrological Modelling Results

Code that performs an evaluation of the efficiency of a hydrological model results.
Can be used to assess daily and monthly results.
Calculation of Nash - Sutcliffe efficiency, Bias and Pbias, Mean Squared Error and Root Mean Squared Error
Box-Cox transformation to asses uncertaity ranges within an interval confidence of 95%

To use the code, change the directories, and prepare the data to be compared of observations and simulations like in the example .csv file provided

Hope it is useful for every user
